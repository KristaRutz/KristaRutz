I'm working as part of Leap _Cohort 23_, a Microsoft initiative to bring more diversity into tech by seeking out people from a variety on non-traditional backgrounds.

I've always been analytical, solution-oriented, and high achieving. I have been a math and science tutor, a Fulbright Scholar, and a hackathon winner. I maintain a high level of growth and achievement in developing my technical expertise, acquiring full-stack JavaScript and C# skills with over 1000 hours of coding experience in personal projects, coding and computer science courses, and as a development intern. In my position at [@EchoEcho](www.github.com/echoecho) as a Software Engineer Intern, I worked mainly with React to engineer a front-end client application. I also led development of [Oranga App](www.github.com/KristaRutz/oranga-app) with a cross-functional team from Co.Lab to develop therapeutic technology for burnt-out professionals. **Technologies:** HTML5, CSS, ES6, TDD, Agile development practices, Redux, Node, RESTful APIs, Docker, Jest unit testing, and SQL databases

New opportunities! I love learning and taking on a breadth of responsibilities and technical challenges. I'm also passionate about design and solving problems that benefit real people and communities.
